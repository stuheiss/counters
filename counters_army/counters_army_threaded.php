/*
    This isn't built in as it's a pretty simple task to achieve for your self
    I can't really think of any functions that are labourious enough that you
    would want to execute them by themselves in a thread of their own. Maybe
    you have functions within your own code that could be called in parallel without
    refactoring for multi-threading capabilities ...

    I personally think you shouldn't try to make chocolate from cheese and you
    would be better of refactoring your code to be multi-threaded ...

    But here's an example of how you would achieve such a task:
